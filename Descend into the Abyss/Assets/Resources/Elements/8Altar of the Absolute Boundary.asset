  Description: "Located in the center of the\_Ido Front, the\_Altar of the Absolute
    Boundary\_is an elevator-like connection between the\_5th\_layer\_and the\_6th\_layer. 
    The Altar can only be activated if an owner of a personal\_Life Reverberating
    Stone\_uses their stone while being inside it.  The capsule artifact, which serves
    the elevator function for travel via the altar, consists out of a combination
    of organic and inorganic elements.  Futhermore, while the entrance section is
    able to be moved separately from the exterior of the capsule, the inside is constantly
    level.  "
