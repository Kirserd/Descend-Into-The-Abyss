  Description: "The\_Garden of the Flowers of Resilience\_is a field in the\_4th\_layer\_that
    is filled with\_Eternal Fortunes.\_It is said by numerous\_Delvers\_that the
    garden is one of the most beautiful places that can be found deep in the\_Abyss. 
    Most of the Delvers, who come across it, rest here for a while just to look at
    the beautiful scenery of the garden.\_It was one of\_Lyza's favored places in
    the Abyss.  The garden was classified as especially dangerous, because of the
    migration of the\_Amaranthine-Deceptor, due to them taking advantage of the cover
    the\_flora\_provides and had to be destroyed. "
  AdditionalInfo: "Ozen\_found the\_Everlasting Pickaxe\_marking a grave in the garden,
    though it was later revealed that the grave was empty.\_The Everlasting Pickaxe
    was given to\_Riko, as it had been her mother's signature weapon.  Later, after
    leaving\_Nanachi's Hideout, Riko,\_Reg\_and\_Nanachi\_are travelling through
    the garden, on the 4th\_layer, when they spot one of\_Bondrewd's\_Umbra Hands.\_When
    Reg goes to go inspect what the Umbra Hand is doing, he is given back the Everlasting
    Pickaxe, which had been lost ever since\_Orb Piercer\_had attacked Reg and Riko.\_As
    Nanachi and Riko observe the situation, Riko notices a bug pretending to be one
    of the Eternal Fortunes.[8]\_Reg finds out from the Umbra Hand that the entire
    garden is infested with deadly Amaranthine-Deceptors.  Amaranthine-Deceptors
    usually reside in the 6th\_layer, but for unknown reasons have begun to infest
    the upper layers as well.\_The Umbra Hand infroms Reg the Amaranthine-Deceptors
    have already increased their population too much in the garden and proceedes
    to burn the whole garden, so that the Amaranthine-Deceptors will not spread any
    further.  "
