  Description: 'Faputa is the last child born from Irumyuui and is referred to as
    "Princess of the Narehate" by the inhabitants of the Narehate Village Ilblu within
    the inviolable 6th layer of the Abyss.   She is described by Majikaja as "the
    embodiment of value", and is incredibly highly regarded by all the Narehate in
    the village.While the citizens of the village are unable to leave it, Faputa
    is actually the opposite, being unable to enter, due to being imbued with the
    Cradles of Desire Irumyuui used to hold. She can speak both the language of Ilblu
    and the language of the Delvers.    '
  AdditionalInfo: Faputa's face, upper arms, and upper torso are dark in color. Her
    hair is long and feathery. Fluffy white fur covers her rabbit-like ears, forearms,
    legs, and lower body, starting at her hips. One of Faputa's most noticeable traits
    is her four arms. On each of her hands are 3 large red claws, which act as fingers,
    with the forth and fifth folded away.[6][7] Futhermore her folded away fingers
    have hidden delicate talons with sensing organs that function similar to the
    sense of smell. Red claw like protrusions are also on her hair, her knees, and
    the ends of her feet, similar to hooves.
