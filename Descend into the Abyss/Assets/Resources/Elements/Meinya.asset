  Description: 'Meinya is Prushka''s pet given to her as a present from her adoptive
    father, Bondrewd, as a tenth birthday present. Its name is a result of Prushka
    not being able to pronounce "Meinastilim" when it was given to her.It later joins
    Reg, Riko, and Nanachi on their adventure to the bottom of the Abyss. '
  AdditionalInfo: Meinya is a rabbit-sized creature called a Meinastilim, also known
    as a child of change. It has an oval shaped body, stubby legs and feet, and large
    ears it uses to fly with. Its face is somewhat resemblant of a toad's as its
    pupils are slitted horizontally across the entire diameter of the eye.  By sniffing
    Meinya's fur, Riko and Prushka are able to navigate Ido Front without succumbing
    to the Curse.
