  Description: "Jeseku, or\_Jisweku, is a remote western country outside of\_Orth. 
    Marulk\_seemingly lived as part of the royalty in Jeseku before travelling to
    the\_Abyss\_with his\_father.  Within the royal family of Jeseku, \"Children
    of the Shadows,\" who are by nature sensitive to sunlight, are occasionally born. 
    These \"Children of the Shadows\" are said to only live to the age of ten, and
    even among the ancient texts of Jeseku it is written that \"Three thousand suns
    will eliminate a child of the shadows.\u201D  To conceal these children from
    the sun, long-established children's clothing, called the \"Moon Outfit,\" is
    worn by them.  "
