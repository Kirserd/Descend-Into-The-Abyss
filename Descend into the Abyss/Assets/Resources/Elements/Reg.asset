  Description: 'Reg is a robotic being who appears to be a little boy. His actual
    age, origins, and even name are unknown because he cannot recall anything about
    his life before his encounter with Riko. He is named after a dog Riko used to
    have.  Having a seemingly artificial body, Reg might be the only being completely
    immune to the Curse of the Abyss. Because of this, he is sometimes referred to
    as "The Treasure of the Deep."   Due to design similarities, Gaburoon wondered
    if Reg and they might share the same creator; noting that Interference Units
    don''t cross layers and them having no data regarding Interference Units of Reg''s
    kind. '
  AdditionalInfo: 'Reg has light brown skin and dark hair. He wears a metal helmet
    with two asymmetrical horns protruding out of the sides and what appears to be
    a glass lens in the front, which, according to Nanachi''s theory, displays the
    number of Incinerator charges he has left to use.   Underneath his helmet is
    a jagged metal headband of some sort, with bolts on either side keeping it in
    place on his head. His ears are slightly pointed. Reg''s eyes are yellow, and
    his pupils are catlike, vertical slits. There are two red patches of skin on
    his cheeks, and four more on either side of his rib cage. His eyebrows are small
    and gray. Though he is a robot, the only parts of him that appear to be mechanical
    are his arms and legs, which are bulky compared to the rest of his body. He has
    nipples, a belly button, and even human genitals. '
