  Description: "Located in the lowest area of the West District,\_The Grand Pier\_is
    an ornate Gondola station used for triumphant returns of\_Delver\_teams.  An
    Abyss cascading gondola system was built at approximately 50 meters below the
    surface to quicken the descent into the Abyss, which goes down 580 meters to
    what\_Riko\_presumes to be the Stone Ark, a rocky protrusion at approximately
    the same depth, and is integrated as part of the Grand Pier.  Protruding Platforms
    for the gondola system are fixed into place using massive bolts and it holds
    a lookout platform, with a signal light, and mooring station for\_Mail Balloons.
    Furthermore, it holds a reverse option for the gondola and a transmission device
    in a room on the platform. It also has a bell, which signals arrivals and depatures,
    and another signal light on top.  The gondola system consists of, and works with,
    various gears such as a main drive gear, a large water wheel, a whinch drive
    gear, a whinch lock, a large whinch, an emergency whinch drive gear and the gondola
    itself on a gondola platform.  When a Delver team returns via the Grand Pier,
    it often draws a significant crowd to welcome them home.  "
