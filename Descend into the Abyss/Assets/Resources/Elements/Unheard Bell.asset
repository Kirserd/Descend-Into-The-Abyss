  Description: The Unheard Bell is a large grey bell with an artistic pattern at
    its upper section and multiple sculpted embedments on the exterior structure. 
    It was discovered in a highly inaccessible location within the 4th layer. Information
    of its location was leaked to multiple countries, sparking a fierce competition
    to recover it. Not many details are known about its use, but it is apparently
    capable of stopping time in some form.
