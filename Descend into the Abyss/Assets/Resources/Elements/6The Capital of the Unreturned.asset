  Description: "The Capital of the Unreturned, referred to as\_\"Shourou\" Layer\_by\_Gaburoon\_and
    translating to\_\"The Capital of the Unreturned\"\_in the language of the former
    native tribe\_Ganja\_encountered, is the 6th\_layer of the\_Abyss.  It is the
    point of no return since it is physically impossible to survive the ascent from
    here, hence the name.\_When a\_White Whistle Delver\_descends down to the 6th\_layer,
    it is called \"The Last Dive,\" as none of them sees the surface ever again. "
  AdditionalInfo: "In the Capital of the Unreturned, the ruins of a majestic city
    sleep undisturbed. A rumor in\_Orth\_exists about a Golden City sleeping at the
    bottom of the Abyss, which supposedly originated from this very city within the
    6th\_layer.\_The city itself is described as golden, however the ruins are covered
    by a crystal of an unknown color and density. It is unclear whether the buildings
    were intentionally made out of this crystal or if they became fossilized over
    time.\_The ruins themselves spread out in every direction, and oftentimes buildings
    are diagonal, upside down, or sideways.\_Creatures of absurd to extraordinary
    danger level become quite common, as are random, bright geo-thermal explosions
    that emit poisonous gas.\_Bird repellent used on the information vessels does
    not work on the aviary species in the 6th\_layer.  It is here that the Narehate
    village,\_Ilblu,\_came into existence with the\_Three Sages\_in charge of it. 
    Beyond the village extends more steep scenery with more ruins as well as ocassional
    fields of\_Eternal Fortunes\_and the habitat of the\_Emperorshells, which exceeds
    the depth of 14000 meters, accompanied by flaming iron rain.  Loacated in an
    isolated section approximately 300 meters before the beginning of the\_7th\_layer\_is
    an\_outpost\_used by\_Hail Hex, the Delver group lead by the White Whistle Delver\_Srajo,
    to operate in the 6th layer. "
