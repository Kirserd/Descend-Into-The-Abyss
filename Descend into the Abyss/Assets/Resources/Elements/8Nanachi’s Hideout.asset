  Description: "Nanachi's Hideout\_is a hut located on the\_4th\_layer, in a space
    chosen by\_Nanachi\_for them and\_Mitty\_to live after escaping\_Ido Front. It
    is tucked in a far corner, away from the vertical shaft of the\_Abyss, so the
    force field and subsequent affects of the curse are not present.  Behind the
    hut, there is a field of\_Eternal Fortunes\_and a series of gravestones. To the
    northwest is the Hidden Hot Spring of Old Animals.("
  AdditionalInfo: "It is here that Nanachi dedicated their time to finding a way
    to end Mitty's life. When Nanachi came across injured\_Delvers\_that were beyond
    help, they would experiment on them using the different poisons and other toxins
    they found on the 4th\_layer, hoping to find a way to permanently kill Mitty.
    While they were not successful in this way, these experiments helped Nanachi
    develop an array of medicines and antidotes using Mitty's blood, which can neutralize
    the effects of any poisons she came into contact with. When done with the Delvers,
    Nanachi would end their misery and bury them in the back, in the field of Eternal
    Fortunes. "
