  Description: Riko is a 12-year-old orphan from the town at the edge of the Abyss,
    Orth. She is the only child of the White Whistle Lyza, the Annihilator. When
    she was two, her mother began her last dive to the bottom of the Abyss, and since
    her father, Torka, had died before she was even born, she was left under the
    care of the Belchero Orphanage. Her dream is to become a White Whistle, a legendary
    type of Delver, and explore the depths of the Abyss with her group in order to
    learn its many secrets and to find her mother.
  AdditionalInfo: She is a good-natured, joyful, and energetic child. She has a quick
    and inquisitive mind, gathering and properly organizing all the information available
    on subjects that interest her. For the team, she is the unbreakable force of
    enthusiasm in the midst of their constant hardships.
