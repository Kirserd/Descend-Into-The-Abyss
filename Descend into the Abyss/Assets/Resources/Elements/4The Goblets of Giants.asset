  Description: It is a sprawling jungle of unique, awe-inspiring and deadly fauna.
    This layer is characterized by a deceptive fusion of beauty and danger.                                                          
    Here, the curse takes the form of intense pain throughout the body and bleeding
    from every orifice.
  AdditionalInfo: "It is a humid jungle of strong vines, weaving giant concave discs
    called\_Flat-creepers.\_The tops of the discs capture water from the air, creating
    shallow pools of hot water. Many creatures, including the\_Orb Piercers, live
    in these shallow pools. The high concentrations of warm water in this region
    causes high humidity and sometimes fog. Additionally, the light from the forcefield
    refracts from the water, giving the scenery of the 4th Layer a blue hue. Every
    two thousand years, the flat-creepers prey-trapping mechanisms wither up, leaving
    the ground underneath exposed to the light. With the obstruction gone, all the
    plants underneath compete to grow as tall and large as they possibly can, giving
    rise to a completely new landscape. Since the landscape is constantly changing,
    no attempts have been made at creating a detailed map of its features, except
    for pointing out non-jungle landmarks. In an area away from the vertical shaft,
    in the upper region of the fourth layer, is\_Nanachi's Hideout. This area is
    unaffected by the curse. In the middle region at the 9,000 meters mark, there
    is the famous\_Garden of the\_Flowers of Resilience, an area filled with\_Eternal
    Fortunes, the trademark flower of the Abyss. The distinctive sight produced by
    the countless glowing flowers make the garden one of the most beautiful landscapes
    of the Abyss. "
