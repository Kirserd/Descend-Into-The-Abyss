  Description: "It is a vast frozen wasteland on top of a massive sea. It also is
    the last layer where it is physically possible for\_Delvers\_to return to the
    surface without losing their humanity or dying.                                                        
    Here, the curse takes the form of extreme sensory deprivation, first draining
    one of their basic senses to the point of\_Riko\_not noticing falling down a
    flight of stairs. The curse then quickly escalates into losing one's very sense
    of self (medically, it is called\_proprioception). This kind of deprivation also
    makes unintentional self-harm extremely likely, like when Riko clenched her jaw
    so hard that she broke her own teeth, not realizing the harm done until she put
    her finger in her mouth and saw blood.  "
  AdditionalInfo: "The 5th\_layer is the world that only White Whistle or Black Whistle
    Delvers delve into, and according to\_Shiggy, one can count the number of people
    who successfully returned alive with the fingers of one's hands. It is the thinnest
    vertical layer of the Abyss, being only 1,000 meters deep, but it is also the
    widest one horizontally, probably around ten times wider than the town of\_Orth.
    It consists mostly of a large sea with some crystallized sections held up by
    a large layer of thick mud and bones, hence the name \"The Sea of Corpses.\"\_The
    water is filled with monsters of the sea, and diving deep into the water is synonymous
    with suicide. Not only are there dangerous creatures, but swimming back up would
    make someone succumb to the curse quite easily. Since it is the last section
    of the Abyss where it is physically possible to survive a return trip, it is
    quite common for White Whistle Delvers to settle down here for some time. At
    the deepest point above the water, a Forward Operating Base named\_Ido Front\_was
    established by the White Whistle\_Bondrewd.Ido Front was originally the ruins
    of a former ritual site where preperations were made and the ritual was held.
    Ido Front gets its electricity from the rotation of the unstoppable whirlpool
    it is built upon. A device akin to an elevator exists in its center, the\_Altar
    of the Absolute Boundary, that is used to transport people through the sea and
    into the\_6th\_layer. However, it can only be activated by a White Whistle, or
    more specifically, by a\_Life Reverberating Stone. Since Life Reverberating Stones
    are specially designed to be exclusively used by their original owners, the elevator
    is only available to those who have a White Whistle of their own. "
