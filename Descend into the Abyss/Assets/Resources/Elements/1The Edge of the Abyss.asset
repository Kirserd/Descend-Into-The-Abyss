  Description: "it\_is the 1st\_layer of the\_Abyss. Its composition is fairly tame
    compared to the deeper, more alien levels. The 1st\_layer is the only part of
    the Abyss that could be considered, in some form, \"safe\".                                                            
    Here, the curse takes the form of mild dizziness and nausea."
  AdditionalInfo: " The 1st layer is the most shallow section of the Abyss, right
    below the town of\_Orth. A gondola system, which is part of the\_Grand Pier,
    was built at approximately 50 meters below the surface to quicken the descent
    into the Abyss, which goes down 580 meters to what\_Riko\_presumed to be the
    Stone Ark, a rocky protrusion at approximately 600 meters.  Located on the 1st\_layer,
    300 meters from the surface, is a\_Burial Tower\_where hundreds of skeletons,
    estimated to be around 2000 years old, lie with their hands clasped in prayer. 
    The environment does not really change, and wildlife consists of mostly harmless
    animals; though occasionally predators from the 2nd\_or\_3rd\_layers might ascend
    in search of food.\_There are not many treasures nor\_Relics\_either, but there
    is a considerable number of\_Praying Skeletons.  Since its danger level is mild,
    inexperienced\_Delvers, such as Red Whistle Delvers, often go down into the 1st\_layer
    to search for Artifacts.  It was here that\_Reg\_was found unconscious by Riko
    after using his\_Incinerator\_to save Riko from a displaced\_Crimson Splitjaw.
    Riko then took Reg back to the\_orphanage.  "
