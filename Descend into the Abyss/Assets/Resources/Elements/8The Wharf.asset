  Description: "The Wharf\_is a section of the South District of the City by the\_Abyss,\_Orth. 
    It is a place built by illegal\_Delvers. Many illegal Delvers came here and settled,
    adding more and more buildings near each other in such little space, causing
    the area to protrude and gradually sink into the Abyss. According to\_Shiggy,
    it is probably the deepest point of the city.  Nat\_was born and once lived in
    the Wharf with his\_sister. He and his sister were forced to scavenge for food
    here. When Nat's sister passed away, Nat, not having any other relatives, was
    picked up by the\_Belchero Orphanage.  Nat later\_returns with Shiggy,\_Riko\_and\_Reg\_to
    the Wharf, where the latter two begin\_their first and final true descent into
    the Abyss.  "
