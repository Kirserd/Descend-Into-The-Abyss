  Description: Prushka is the adoptive daughter of the White Whistle Delver Bondrewd.
    She was born in the Abyss and, as such, has never been to the surface.                                                                                           
    ''My name, Prushka, means the flower of dawn. Papa gave it to me. Hey, Riko.
    Have you ever seen a dawn?''
  AdditionalInfo: Prushka is a young girl with short white and green curly hair and
    glowing red eyes. Her attire appears to be somewhat influenced by the clothing
    of diving suits. She wears a green coat and gloves on top of a white shirt, as
    well as a big hat on her head she almost never removes.
