  Name: 'The village of Ilblu '
  Icon: {fileID: 0}
  Description: "Ilblu, or\_Iruburu,\_is a village in the\_6th\_layer\_inhabited entirely
    by\_Narehate, created by the\_three Sages. The force field does not exist in
    the village, and by extension, neither does the curse.  Narehate in Ilblu take
    the form of what it is they most desire, and are granted the village's protection.
    In exchange, they are bound to the village, and a force field prevents them from
    leaving.  The village itself seems to be somewhat sophisticated. It has\_restaurants,
    inns, and a system of currency.  The main industry in the village is trading
    based on the concept of \"value.\" The inhabitants are constantly trading and
    bartering for things of equal or higher value.\_An item's value seems to be self
    determined by whoever is in possession of the item, as well as by the village
    itself based on the importance the item has to its owner.\_It is such an important
    concept, that when a customer damages an item before it is paid for, an event
    called \"The Balancing\" occurs. A noise rings out across the village, and one
    of the perpetrator's possessions of equal value is destroyed. The perpetrator
    may even be maimed in order to compensate for the defacement, if the value of
    the damaged item is high enough.  Humans are of especially high value, especially
    human children.  Furthermore, inhabitants of the village are able to use the
    Balancing, or a concept attributed to it, to seemingly use it as an omnipotent
    tool of creation, or recreation, as long as the user has a concise image of what
    they desire and can compensate for it. However, it isn't specifed if the value
    compensation is based on the creators perception of the thing to create or by
    the understanding of the village of it.  It also is unknown if it is possible
    to use \"lower value\", which manifests as currency of the village, to compensate
    in this instance or if it requires the use of the one's body as the only instances
    of usage had the respective inhabitants compensate with their bodies.   Since
    the Narehate of Ilblu cannot leave, the only way they can hunt is to lure prey
    into the city. "
  AdditionalInfo: "The village was created by members of\_Ganja, who originally set
    out to find ,what natives called, \"Shourou's Golden City\" on the 6th\_layer
    of the\_Abyss.\_After learning from\_Interference Units\_they met that they wouldn't
    be able to return to the surface, Ganja set up a permanent camp on the 6th\_layer. 
    After some time, many Ganja members got ill and\_Belaf\_found out that the cause
    of the sickness was the water they had been drinking, due to it being infected
    by some\_unknown creature\_of the Abyss.\_During the time of the illness spreading,
    an\_Artifact\_was discovered, by members of Ganja who hadn't fallen ill, that
    granted the deepest wish of a person while holding if their mind wasn't too \"complex\";\_Cradle
    of Desire.  Vueko\_requested it to be given to\_Irumyuui, a native girl who had
    accompanied them as guide, in hope to save her from the illness.\_Wazukyan, the
    leader of Ganja, agreed and the Artifact was given to Irumyuui.\_The Cradle of
    Desire caused Irumyuui to transform and gave her the ability to birth\_creatures\_without
    organs for ingestion, dying shortly after birth.\_Ganja resorted to use them
    as source of sustenance, as they lacked other viable options.\_At some point
    in time, a second Cradle of Desire was given to Irumyuui by Wazukyan.  Over time,
    Irumyuui transformed more and more until she reached her final stage with the
    ability to transform humans into Narehate.\_In this form, she had already lost
    her consciousness and became the base of the village.\_Due to Vueko not agreeing
    with this, she tried to take her own life and was imprisoned in the part of the
    village that used to be Irumyuui's head, in order to keep her from harming herself. 
    Some time later,\_Faputa\_was born, due to the wish Irumyuui had made with the
    second Cradle of Desire, and unlike the Narehate transformed by the village who
    can't leave it, Faputa can't enter it.  After\_Reg\_had brought back body parts
    of Faputa into the village to trade them for\_Nanachi, it reacts to them and\_Juroimoh\_starts
    to attack to claim the parts.\_In the battle with Juroimoh, Reg shoots his incinerator
    creating an opening in the village causing damage to its protective boundary
    and it starts to disperse.\_This leads to a confrontation between Faputa, the
    villagers and Reg, which is ultimately interrupted by creatures of the 6th\_layer
    swarming into the village and beginning to wreak havoc.  The village started
    to crumble and fade away completely after Faputa used her control over it to
    start a process of taking in its remaining value and it ultimately vanished completely
    leaving only rubble from its collapse behind.   \"Iruburu\" (Ilblu) means: \u2981\t\"village\"
