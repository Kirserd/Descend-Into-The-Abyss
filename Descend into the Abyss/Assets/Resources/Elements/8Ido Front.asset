  Description: "Ido Front, also known as the\_Forward Operating Base, is a research
    station located at the bottom of the\_5th\_layer. It is the deepest a person
    can go and still survive the\_curse.\_It is the place where\_White Whistle Delvers\_begin
    their Last Dive.  Its main purpose is as a gateway into the\_6th\_layer. Its
    center, the\_Altar of the Absolute Boundary, acts as an elevator through the
    Sea of Corpses, and it can only be activated by the sound of a\_White Whistle. "
  AdditionalInfo: "Long ago, Ido Front was originally the ruins of a former ritual
    site where preperations were made and the ritual was held.\_Since then, it has
    been transformed into\_Bondrewd's\_main base of operations.\_Here he conducts
    experiments in warding the curse.  It was here that Bondrewd brought\_Nanachi,\_Mitty\_and
    other children to act as his test subjects, and where Nanachi and Mitty were
    transformed into\_Narehate\_after ascending from the\_Miniature Garden of Dawn.\_It
    is also the place where Bondrewd raised\_Prushka\_as his adopted daughter before
    turning her into a cartridge.  "
