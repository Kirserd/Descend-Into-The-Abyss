  Description: "The\_Miniature Garden Of Dawn\_is a part of the\_Ido Front, the Forward
    Operating Base between the\_5th\_layer\_and\_6th\_layer, constructed by\_Bondrewd.\_It
    dips into the 6th\_layer and is used as a testing ground for Bondrewd's experiments
    in warding off the curse. This is where most of the byproduct\_Narehate\_from
    said experiments are disposed, and the last place where\_Mitty\_and\_Nanachi\_were
    still human before being transformed into Narehate. "
