  Description: "The Abyss\_is a colossal pit discovered 1,900 years ago around the
    islands of the southern ocean of Beolusk. The vertical hole has a diameter of
    around 1,000 meters and is at least 20,000 meters deep, with its exact depth
    being currently unknown.\_It possesses a unique ecosystem, wherein lie the remnants
    of an ancient, yet advanced, civilization. Many have challenged the mysterious
    Abyss, pursuing countless hidden treasures and relics of immense value. Some
    are treasure hunters looking for\_Artifacts, while others are explorers determined
    to unveil the secrets the Abyss hides.\_To explore the Abyss, valiant cave raiders
    called\_Delvers\_emerged, and the town of\_Orth\_was established at the edge
    of the Abyss.  The Abyss still contains many sections that have never been seen,
    and carries many dangers. Hazardous habitats that defy common sense and otherworldly\_creatures\_adapted
    to the unique environment are major obstacles to explorers.  All over the Abyss,
    there is a mysterious force field which\_Nanachi\_refers to as the \"very blood
    of the Abyss, so to speak\". The force field acts as its main source of energy,
    sustaining life by carrying sunlight and nutrients down into the depths where
    it would otherwise be impossible for light to reach. While it is present everywhere,
    it seems to be more prominent the closer one gets to the center of the vertical
    shaft.\_More savage and dangerous creatures are often found in areas where the
    force field is most prevalent, and the branches of vegetation always point towards
    the center of the hole, their main source of energy for undergoing photosynthesis.\_Delvers
    use this fact to guide themselves when they are lost. The force field itself
    is invisible to the naked eye, but it can be detected as a vague fog that limits
    the vision of humans.\_The field is also constantly moving, following the movements
    of living beings to the point of breathing being enough to change its flow, and
    altering its flow as it responds to their consciousness. There are a few specific
    spots in the Abyss, usually far away from the center and in secluded areas, where
    the force field doesn't exist or is extremely weak.  The great pit also appears
    to have some form of time distortion. This is evident by\_Ganja\_having arrived
    at the Abyss at a point in time before the first Delvers and a native tribe still
    existed, yet, according to\_Wazukyan, only 150 years have passed since the creation
    of the\_Village of Ilblu\_in the\_6th\_Layer.\_The\_White Whistle Delver\_Ozen\_claims
    that the deeper one delves, the more one's sense of time breaks, with the effect
    becoming extreme from the\_5th\_layer\_onwards. As an example, she noted people
    might intend to stay on the 5th\_layer just a few weeks, but by the time they
    return to the surface, several months had passed. As such, Ozen considers it
    a possibility a decade on the surface may be akin to a few years on the bottom
    of the Abyss. "
  AdditionalInfo: "Though the Abyss is riddled with countless dangers and hazards,
    one of the greatest challenges facing Delvers is, in fact, the ascent from it.
    This is due to a phenomenon called the\_Curse of the Abyss. The term refers to
    a series of symptoms that manifest upon ascending while inside the Abyss, with
    its more scientific name being the\_\"Strains of Ascension\". The effects of
    the Curse manifest after ascending around 10 meters within the Abyss, and there
    is no way to avoid it through conventional means.\_The Curse affects all living
    things; however, the creatures that inhabit the Abyss have developed ways to
    sense its flow and avoid it. The deeper one delves, the more severe the symptoms
    are, starting at mild dizziness and nausea and gradually rising to intense pain
    throughout the body, loss of senses and even death. This makes the return trip
    from the Abyss extremely difficult, and it is not uncommon for Delvers to perish
    on the way up. Particularly, the curse of the 6th\_layer (\"loss of humanity
    or death\") makes the return journey physically impossible for humans. The Curse
    results from piercing the force field of the Abyss while ascending, although
    this fact is not generally known. With Layer piled upon Layer, the force field
    blankets living beings similar to cloth warping around them. Its flow is similar
    to inverted thorns, allowing one to pass through in descent, but being harmful
    when trying to ascend.  Areas where the force field is weaker also result in
    the effects of the curse being less severe. In certain specific places, like\_Nanachi's
    hideout\_and\_the Village of Ilblu, the force field isn't present at all, and
    so the Curse doesn't occur either.  "
