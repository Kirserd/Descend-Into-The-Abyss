  Description: "The\_Plummet Pub\_is a\_Delver\_tavern and spot for information exchange
    that is run by a retired Delver.  The establishment was given it's oddly inauspicious
    name out of the idea that, \"By coming to an unlucky place, you will have better
    luck on your next delve.\u201D  It's slogan is, \"Serving the last meals Delvers
    want to eat before they die\", with the former cooks of Delver groups, and would-be
    trainees, running the kitchen and showing their skills. The wait staff also consists
    out of Blue Whistle Delvers, who can't make a living on delving alone.  Its status
    as information exchange is more fluid. While the gossip exchanged in the shop
    is supposed to be \"for your ears only\", it makes the rounds in the local Delver
    population.  Tourists interested in local gourmet food who visit the area report:
    \"What Delvers really come for a bite of is romanticism and an adventurous mood.\" 
    Tourists are seated in a better part of the pub away from Delvers. For those
    who want a taste of the Delver lifestyle, there is no other way than to become
    a Delver.  "
