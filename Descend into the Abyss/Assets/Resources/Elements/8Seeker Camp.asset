  Description: "The\_Seeker Camp\_is an observation camp lying at 2,540m deep in
    the Inverted Forest.  It is located far from the center of the\_Abyss\_because
    the Curse of the Abyss is weakened here, giving\_Delvers\_a place to rest and
    prepare for the descent into the\_3rd\_layer.  It was built from a particularly
    large tree in the Inverted Forest, called the Great Tree of Porta.  The tree
    being larger than other trees in the area, despite the environment being darker
    and colder, is theorized by the inhabitants of the Seeker Camp to have the roots
    of it reaching the nutritious sediment level of the Sea of Beoluska, causing
    the tree to receive more water and nutrition than the other trees.  It is currently
    a base for the White Whistle Delver\_Ozen\_and her team of Delvers, the\_Subterranean
    Bandits.  "
