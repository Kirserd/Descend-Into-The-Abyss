  Description: "The\_Gate to the Netherworld\_is a stone archway, overgrown with\_flora,
    seen in both the\_Anime\_and\_Manga.\_It appears to be one of the primary methods
    for\_Delvers\_entering the\_Abyss\_down into the\_1st\_layer.  The arch appears
    to always have at least one guardsman ensuring no unauthorised traffic passes,
    leading to\_Riko\_and friends having to find an alternative way into the Abyss. 
    It appears to be in a anti-clockwise direction from\_Belchero Orphanage, but
    it is unknown if this means it is in the South, or East Districts.  "
