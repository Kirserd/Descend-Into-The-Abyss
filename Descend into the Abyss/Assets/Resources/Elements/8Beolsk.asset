  Description: "Beolsk, or\_Beoluska, is the name of a country outside of\_Orth,
    from where Orth imports products such as rice. The country is separated into
    East Beolsk and West Beolsk. East Beolsk is an archipelago.  When\_Jiruo\_visits\_Ozen\_he
    brings her containers of exotic food from West Beolsk.  Orth refers to some isolated
    islands and towns that encompass the Abyss, while Beolsk is a more macro distinction
    that includes the entirety of that, plus other islands and territories. Beolsk
    is the country encompassing those islands as an archipelago. As a country, Beolsk
    is a large and powerful nation-state. It encompasses not just those islands,
    but also parts of the nearest continent, in its territory. However, some events
    led to the area being split up into East Beolsk and West Beolsk.  Orth is located
    in Beolsk in the southern seas, and the Abyss is protected by the nation so that
    people from other countries can't abuse it. One of those policies is requiring
    Delvers to earn their whistles through a licensing system. "
