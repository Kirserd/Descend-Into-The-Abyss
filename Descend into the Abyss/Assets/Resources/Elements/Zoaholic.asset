  Description: The Zoaholic, also called the Soul-Slave Machine, is a giant vulva-shaped
    Artifact. While inactive, it protectively closes itself up. Zoaholic allows the
    user to transplant their mind into other living beings, spreading the consciousness
    throughout multiple bodies. All minds that the user's mind has been transplanted
    into are also able to share thoughts with each other. However, humans are incapable
    of enduring the division of their consciousness and thus, after a short while
    of using Zoaholic, abnormalities begin to surface; including the subjects going
    insane. Eventually, their consciousness disperses and they become invalid.
