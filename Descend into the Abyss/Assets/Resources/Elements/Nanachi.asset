  Name: Nanachi
  Icon: {fileID: 21300000, guid: 2bcc28d9433dd6144b1f5971a49d76f1, type: 3}
  Description: Nanachi is a Narehate; a person who survived the 6th layer's Curse
    of the Abyss and was left deformed as a result, but, unlike most other Narehate,
    still retained a sound mind. Possessing vast knowledge of the Abyss - its ecosystem,
    vegetation and even the use of the medicines, Nanachi is currently a part of
    Riko's party, assisting her in reaching the bottom of the Abyss. Their gender
    is ambiguous.
  AdditionalInfo: Nanachi's appearance is very rabbit-like, save for a long sturdy
    tail, horizontally slanted pupils, carnivorous teeth and human-like hair; which
    is straight and cream-white in a short bobbed style, the sides of the bangs going
    down to the shoulders. In contrast, medium tan fur covers the rest of Nanachi,
    with light tan covering the insides of their ears and belly. They have a blush-like
    spot on each cheek; which has two thick whiskers protruding sideways. Other animal
    traits include a cat-like mouth with little fangs, yellow eyes with horizontal
    oval shaped pupils (similar to a goat's) and erect bunny ears. Their fingers
    are rather stubby though surprisingly agile, as they are very artistically skilled.
