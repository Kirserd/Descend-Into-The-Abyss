  Description: "it is the 2nd\_layer of the\_Abyss. It is a large forest with surprisingly
    diverse environments, and it is here where one truly gains an understanding of
    the horrors of the Abyss.                                                     
    Here, the curse takes the form of intense nausea, headache, and numbness of limbs."
  AdditionalInfo: "The Forest of Temptation is the first truly dangerous section
    of the Abyss. The fauna and environment suddenly change, turning into a tropical
    rainforest with huge vegetation. It is filled with dangerous beasts and ascending
    becomes increasingly difficult, making it a place where only experienced explorers
    can delve to. If a\_Red Whistle Delver\_somehow gets to the 2nd\_layer, search
    parties are called off and it is treated as a suicide.  Throughout the top half
    of the layer, there is a forest of massive plants resembling lilypads. These
    plants provide good cover from potential threats; however, they also obscure
    view of the landscape, resulting in Delvers having difficult times telling where
    they are. Luckily, their leaves always point toward the center of the Abyss.
    So with that in mind, and the fact that\_Amagiri\_grows on their stems, lost
    Delvers can find their way relatively easily.  There is an unknown virus in this
    layer which causes Tachikiri fever. Delvers ranked Blue Whistle and above take
    a vaccine to protect themselves from said virus. Deeper in this layer, there
    is an area known as the \"Inverted Forest\". This is an area where updrafts and
    wind currents coming from the Abyss are so strong that the environment effectively
    flips, creating a forest of upside-down platforms that Delvers have to jump across\u2014even
    water flows upwards. The Force Field of the Abyss, the cause of the Strain of
    Ascension, is weaker here compared to the other areas of the 2nd\_layer. Thus
    the environment here is also darker and colder. Because of the weakened Force
    Field, an\_observation camp was built from a particularly large tree in the Inverted
    Forest, the Great Tree of Porta, to serve as a resting point for Delvers. The
    camp is now called\_Seeker Camp, and is run by the legendary White Whistle Delver\_Ozen\_and
    her team of Delvers, the\_Subterranean Bandits. "
