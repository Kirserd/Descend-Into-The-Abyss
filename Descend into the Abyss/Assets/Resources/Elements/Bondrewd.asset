  Description: 'Bondrewd "The Novel", also known as "The Lord of Dawn", "The Sovereign
    of Dawn", is a legendary White Whistle Delver who has made many great discoveries
    about the secrets of the Abyss. A researcher fascinated by the Abyss, he has
    often resorted to illegal and morally questionable means in order to get funds
    and to conduct his research, including selling Artifacts and information from
    the depths illicitly, developing dangerous drugs, and even experimenting on living
    humans. His methods went against all the ethical principles of Delvers, but he
    was allowed to continue due to his outstanding results.                                                                    
    Ten years ago, he did the unthinkable by establishing a large base named the
    Ido Front in the deepest area within the 5th layer of the Abyss, as well as securing
    a route to the then-inviolable 6th layer. '
  AdditionalInfo: Bondrewd is a tall man sporting mostly black clothing, with a long
    coat and a suit. He always covers his face with a black helmet which includes
    a gap in the middle where violet light shines through. His second body also has
    a lizard-like tail, which originates from the Artifact Third Works.
