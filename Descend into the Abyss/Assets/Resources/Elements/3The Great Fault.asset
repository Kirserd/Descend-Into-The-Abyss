  Description: "is the 3rd\_layer of the\_Abyss, being a narrow, 4 kilometer gorge
    surrounded by countless interlocking caverns with many creatures, both harmless
    and deadly, lurking inside.                                                                  
    Here, the curse takes the form of severe vertigo and nausea combined with visual
    and auditory hallucinations."
  AdditionalInfo: "The 3rd\_layer is a 4000m vertical drop down a circular shaft.
    The only viable way of traversing it is through a network of caverns, dens, and
    holes. These were likely made both naturally and by\_Delvers, ancient humans,
    and the\_Neritantans\_that live in them.\_The vertical drop is significantly
    smaller in diameter than the other levels of the Abyss, as evidenced by the\_Abyss
    Map.  This layer is home to large aerial predators, such as\_Madokajacks.\_Crimson
    Splitjaws\_have also been known to use their brute strength to infiltrate the
    side caves in order to capture their prey.\_Amakagame\_are also located in the
    cave systems and can pose a threat to Delvers.\_However, their main source of
    sustenance are Neritantans and they do not actively hunt humans. While the inner
    caverns mainly house non-aggressive creatures, occasionally Madokajacks will
    nest in the larger caves.  Once at the 6750m mark, the central shaft has many
    spiky eggs stuck along its walls.\_The eggs hatch into\_Kazura Squid\_that swim
    in the tallest goblets in the fourth level.  An ancient 'pirate ship' was seen
    partially exposed in the side of the Great Fault.  "
